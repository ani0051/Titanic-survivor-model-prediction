Titanic Survivor Analysis:
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore survival patterns based on different factors like class, age, and gender.

Steps:
Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and preprocess data.
Data Analysis – Visualize survival distribution using graphs.
Train & Test Data – Split dataset for model training.
Model Evaluation – Measure accuracy and performance.

Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)

Goal:
To predict passenger survival using machine learning models.
